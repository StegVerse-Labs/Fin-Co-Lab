# Pilot B — Micro-Economy Sandbox
## Volatility & Stability Simulation (Zero-Risk)

---

## What This Is

We’re launching a temporary, voluntary micro-economy sandbox.

It runs for 6 weeks.
It uses simulated units (SVU).
No real money.
No financial risk.
No conversion to currency.

This is not an investment.
This is not a token.
This is not a crypto launch.
This is not a political initiative.

It is a structured sandbox to explore how small communities behave under guardrails.

## What Makes This Different

This sandbox is designed to test:

- Liquidity pressure
- Volatility containment
- Essential access protection
- Emergency stabilization behavior
- Participant coordination under constraints

You will:

- Exchange simulated value
- Offer services or tasks
- Experience transfer caps
- Encounter stabilization events
- See system health metrics published

The system is transparent.
There is no hidden authority.
No admin override.
No scoring.

## Why Run This?

Many economic systems struggle with:

- Panic cascades
- Liquidity shocks
- Emergency overreach
- Loss of trust

This sandbox tests whether guardrails can:

- Contain instability
- Preserve autonomy
- Avoid coercion
- Remain understandable
- Remain voluntary

The goal is learning, not winning.

---

## What You Receive

At start:

- 10,000 Vault SVU
- 500 Pocket SVU
- 100 SVU essential cap per epoch
- 250 SVU vault→pocket transfer cap per epoch

Epoch = 48 hours.

You can:
- Exchange Pocket SVU with others
- Save Vault SVU
- Plan around caps
- Coordinate voluntarily

---

## What You Will Experience

At unpredictable moments:

- Essential demand spikes
- Liquidity clustering
- Temporary Stabilization Mode (DSM)
- Transparency events
- Possibly simulated rumor events

These are part of the stress test.

---

## What This Is Not

- No leaderboard
- No ranking
- No financial gain
- No loss
- No permanent records
- No external reporting

It ends automatically after 6 weeks.

---

## What We Measure

Aggregate metrics only:

- Guardrail pressure
- Cap clustering
- DSM reaction
- Participation persistence
- Panic containment

No individual behavioral scoring.
No identity tracking.
No hidden analytics.

---

## Your Rights

You may:

- Exit at any epoch boundary
- Stop participating at any time
- Request deletion of identifiable communication
- Receive final results summary

Participation is voluntary.

---

## What Success Looks Like

Success is:

- Essential access preserved
- No runaway panic
- Guardrails understood
- No perception of hidden control
- Participants remain voluntarily engaged

---

## How to Join

Reply with:

“I consent to participate in Pilot B sandbox.”

You’ll receive:

- Onboarding Guide
- Simulation Rulebook
- Epoch calendar
- Communication channel access

## Important

This sandbox may feel constrained at times.
That tension is part of the learning process.

The goal is to see whether guardrails reduce fragility
without reducing autonomy.
