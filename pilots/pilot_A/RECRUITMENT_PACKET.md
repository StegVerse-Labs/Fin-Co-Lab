# Pilot A — Structured Research Simulation
## Financial Guardrail Clarity & Stability Study

---

## What This Is

You are invited to participate in a 6-week structured simulation designed to test:

- Financial guardrail clarity
- Volatility containment mechanisms
- Emergency stabilization behavior
- Transparency and governance signaling

This is NOT:
- A real currency
- A financial product
- An investment vehicle
- A savings program
- A political initiative

This is a structured systems simulation.

No real money.
No financial risk.
No legal entanglement.

## Why This Study Exists

Modern financial systems experience volatility that can create:
- Panic cascades
- Liquidity stress
- Emergency overreach
- Confusion about rules

This study tests whether a voluntary guardrail architecture can:

- Preserve essential access
- Contain volatility
- Maintain autonomy
- Avoid central authority creep
- Remain understandable under stress

---

## What You Will Do

Over 6 weeks, you will:

- Participate in simulated economic exchanges
- Experience structured “epoch” cycles (48 hours each)
- Encounter guardrails (caps, stabilization mode, expiry)
- Provide feedback on clarity and perception

You will receive:
- Simulated units (SVU)
- A Vault balance
- A Pocket balance
- Essential spending limits
- Transparent rules

You will not:
- Risk money
- Be scored
- Be ranked
- Be penalized
- Be tracked individually for performance

## What We Are Measuring

We are evaluating:

- Messaging clarity
- Guardrail understanding
- Panic containment
- Perception of authority
- Stability under stress

We are NOT evaluating:

- Intelligence
- Financial ability
- Moral behavior
- Economic skill

## Time Commitment

- Total duration: 6 weeks
- Active phase: 5 weeks
- Epoch length: 48 hours
- Weekly time requirement: ~30–60 minutes

You may exit at any epoch boundary.

---

## Your Rights

You may:

- Leave at any time
- Withdraw participation without penalty
- Request deletion of identifiable communication
- Ask questions at any time
- Receive a final summary regardless of exit timing

---

## Confidentiality

- No personal financial information collected
- No identity-based scoring
- No behavioral profiling
- Only aggregate system-level metrics published

---

## Structure Overview

Each participant receives:

- 10,000 Vault SVU
- 500 Pocket SVU
- 100 SVU essential cap per epoch
- 250 SVU transfer cap per epoch

Occasionally:
- Stabilization Mode (DSM) may activate
- Essential demand spikes may occur

All rules are transparent and versioned.

---

## What Success Looks Like

The system succeeds if:

- Essential access remains intact
- Emergency modes expire correctly
- Participants understand guardrails
- No one feels controlled
- Voluntary participation persists

## Final Note

This is a learning exercise.

Your participation improves clarity, not compliance.
