Over the past year I’ve been building and stress-testing a constraint-first economic simulation framework.

Before going further, I’m running a 6-week zero-risk sandbox to test it with real participants.

This is not a currency.
Not a token.
Not an investment.
No real money involved.

It’s a structured simulation exploring one question:

Can small groups remain stable under volatility using transparent guardrails — without central authority or coercion?

Participants will experience:
	•	Transfer caps
	•	Essential access limits
	•	Temporary stabilization events
	•	Transparent system health metrics
	•	48-hour epochs
	•	Controlled stress moments

Time commitment:
~30–60 minutes per week for 6 weeks.

Two cohorts:
Pilot A — structured research framing
Pilot B — emergent sandbox framing

Looking for ~25 participants per cohort.

If you’re curious about systems, stability, or how constraints shape behavior, message me and I’ll send the short application.

No financial risk.
Voluntary.
Ends automatically.
