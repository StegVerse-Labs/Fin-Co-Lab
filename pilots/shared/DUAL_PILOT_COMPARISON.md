## Key Insight

Did framing materially alter stability?
<Yes / No / Partially>

If yes, how?

---

## Architectural Implications

What must change:
- Messaging?
- Guardrail tuning?
- DSM language?
- Transparency cadence?

What remains robust?

---

## Final Determination

Does this architecture:

- Preserve essential access?
- Contain volatility?
- Avoid coercion?
- Maintain autonomy?

Verdict:
<Stable / Iteration Required / Structural Rework Required>
