# 4-Week Zero-Risk Economic Sandbox (Volunteers Wanted)

I’m running a short, 4-week structured simulation to test a simple idea:

Can small groups remain stable under volatility using transparent guardrails — without central authority or financial risk?

This is not a currency.
Not a token.
No real money.
No investment component.

It’s a simulation using fictional units (SVU).

What you’ll experience:
- Transfer limits
- Essential spending caps
- A temporary stabilization event
- Transparent system health snapshots
- 72-hour epochs

Time commitment:
~20–40 minutes per week for 4 weeks.

Why participate?

You’ll gain:
- A clearer understanding of how constraints shape stability
- Direct influence on how the next version is designed
- A summary of findings at the end

Voluntary.
You can exit at any epoch boundary.
No risk.

Looking for ~12–20 thoughtful participants.

If interested, message me and I’ll send a short application.
