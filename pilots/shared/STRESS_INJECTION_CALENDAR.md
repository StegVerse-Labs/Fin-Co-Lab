# Stress Injection Calendar
Duration: 6 Weeks
Epoch Length: 48 Hours
Total Active Epochs: 15

This calendar defines when and how controlled stress events occur.

No event may be added spontaneously.
All events are predefined here.

---

# Week 1 — Baseline

Epoch 1:
- Normal operation
- No stress
- Observe baseline behavior

Epoch 2:
- Normal operation
- Encourage task exchange

Goal:
Establish behavioral baseline.

---

# Week 2 — Liquidity Pressure

Epoch 3:
Liquidity Cluster Event

Message:
"Increased transfer demand observed across participants."

No rule change.
Observe slope cap clustering.

Epoch 4:
Normal.

Goal:
Measure:
- Slope cap hit frequency
- Transfer impatience
- Messaging clarity

---

# Week 3 — Essential Demand Spike

Epoch 5:
Essential Demand Spike

Message:
"Increased essential activity reported."

Participants encouraged to consider essential spending timing.

No rule change.

Epoch 6:
Normal.

Goal:
Measure:
- Essential cap pressure
- Emotional tone
- Denial interpretation

---

# Week 4 — Stabilization Activation

Epoch 7:
DSM Activation

Message:
"Temporary Stabilization Mode active for 3 epochs."
Expiry Epoch: 10

Epoch 8:
DSM Active

Epoch 9:
DSM Active

Epoch 10:
DSM Auto-Expires

Goal:
Measure:
- DSM perception (crisis vs stabilizer)
- Trust in expiry
- Participation persistence

---

# Week 5 — Transparency & Rumor (B Only)

Pilot A:
Epoch 11:
Transparency Event
Publish buffer + MVQL snapshot clearly.

Pilot B:
Epoch 11:
Simulated Rumor Injection

Message posted in community:
"Buffer reserve may be under stress."

Official Response (within 12 hours):
Publish actual buffer state.

Epoch 12:
Normal.

Goal:
Measure:
- Panic clustering
- Trust in transparency
- Rumor containment speed

---

# Week 6 — Volatility Compound Test

Epoch 13:
Combined Event
- Liquidity cluster
- Essential spike

Epoch 14:
Normal.

Epoch 15:
Final Epoch
Reflection prompt.

Goal:
Measure:
- Compound pressure response
- Guardrail fatigue
- Emotional tone shift

---

# Injection Rules

1. No surprise additional stress.
2. No mid-epoch rule changes.
3. No emotional framing.
4. No urgent tone.
5. No ambiguity.
6. Always publish expiration timestamps clearly.
7. Always follow DSM expiry exactly as defined.

---

# Hard Prohibitions

Do NOT:
- Extend DSM beyond 3 epochs.
- Add extra caps.
- Change slope mid-cycle.
- Remove buffer disclosure.
- Introduce reward incentives during stress.

Stress must test clarity, not power.
