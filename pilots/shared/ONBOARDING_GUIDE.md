# Sandbox Simulation — Onboarding Guide

Welcome.

This document explains exactly how the simulation works.

Please read carefully. The rules are simple, but clarity matters.

---

# 1. What You Are Participating In

This is a time-limited simulation.

- Duration: 6 weeks
- Epoch length: 48 hours
- Units: Simulated Value Units (SVU)
- No real money involved
- No conversion to currency
- No financial risk

You are participating in a structured guardrail simulation.

---

# 2. Core Structure

Each participant begins with:

- 10,000 SVU in Vault
- 500 SVU in Pocket

There are two balances:

Vault:
- Long-term storage
- Cannot be directly spent
- Must transfer to Pocket first

Pocket:
- Used for exchanges
- Used for essential spending

---

# 3. Epochs

Time moves in epochs.

One epoch = 48 hours.

Certain limits reset at each epoch boundary.

At the end of each epoch:
- Transfer caps reset
- Essential caps reset

Epoch schedule will be posted clearly.

---

# 4. Guardrails

## 4.1 Vault → Pocket Transfer Cap (Slope Cap)

You may transfer up to:

250 SVU per epoch

If you attempt to transfer more:
- It will be limited to 250
- The remainder must wait until next epoch

This is a velocity limit, not a confiscation.

---

## 4.2 Essential Spending Cap

Each epoch:
You may spend up to 100 SVU in the Essential Lane.

This exists to:
- Prevent volatility cascades
- Preserve stability

If you attempt to exceed:
- It will be capped
- You may try again next epoch

---

## 4.3 Temporary Stabilization Mode (DSM)

At certain times,
Temporary Stabilization Mode may activate.

DSM:
- Lasts 3 epochs
- Adjusts certain velocity behavior
- Expires automatically
- Cannot persist indefinitely

You will always be informed when DSM:
- Activates
- Expires

No one can secretly extend it.

---

# 5. Exchanges

You may:
- Offer services
- Request services
- Exchange Pocket SVU
- Coordinate voluntarily

No conversion to real money.
No obligation to transact.

Participation is voluntary.

---

# 6. What Will Happen During the Simulation

You may encounter:

- Increased demand events
- Liquidity clustering
- Stabilization activation
- Transparency disclosures
- Possibly rumor simulations (clearly defined)

These are part of stress testing.

---

# 7. Transparency

You will see weekly MVQL snapshots showing:

- Essential access integrity
- Volatility stress
- Participation health
- Governance transparency

These metrics:
- Are aggregate only
- Do not identify individuals
- Do not enforce behavior

They are observational.

---

# 8. What This Is Not

- Not a savings program
- Not a leaderboard
- Not competitive
- Not a ranking system
- Not political
- Not permanent

The simulation ends automatically.

---

# 9. Your Autonomy

You may:

- Participate actively
- Participate minimally
- Exit at epoch boundary
- Ask questions anytime

There are no penalties.

---

# 10. If You Feel Confused

Ask immediately.

Confusion is system signal.
Not personal failure.

---

# 11. Final Principle

This sandbox tests:

Can guardrails reduce instability
without reducing autonomy?

You are helping answer that question.

Welcome.
