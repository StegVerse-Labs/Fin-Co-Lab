Thanks for reaching out.

This is a 6-week structured simulation with ~30–60 minutes/week commitment.

If that works for you, I’ll send the short application.

Cohorts are capped at 25 each.



I’m not trying to prove anything ideological.

I’m trying to understand whether the architecture is clear, usable, and engaging in practice — and how small groups react to transparent constraints under mild stress.

If the system causes confusion, disengagement, or instability, that’s valuable signal.

If it holds together calmly, that’s also signal.

That keeps it neutral.

If someone presses further:

So what’s the real goal?

You can respond:

To see whether transparent guardrails can reduce volatility without feeling coercive.

If they can’t, that’s important to learn.

Short.
Calm.
Non-grandiose.
