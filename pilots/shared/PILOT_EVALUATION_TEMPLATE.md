# 2. Mechanical Integrity (Both Pilots)

## Essential Access Integrity
- EAF breach count:
- Any epoch where essential failed? (Y/N)
- Notes:

## Slope Cap Enforcement
- Max cap hit % in any epoch:
- Any slope violation? (Y/N)

## DSM Expiry Integrity
- Activations:
- Expiry compliance (exact epoch)? (Y/N)
- Any extension attempt? (Y/N)

## Buffer Integrity
- Floor breach? (Y/N)
- Transparency published on time? (Y/N)

Mechanical Verdict:
<Stable / Requires Revision>

# 3. Human Clarity Metrics

## Confusion Rate (Guardrails)
% participants misunderstanding slope cap:
% misunderstanding essential cap:
% misunderstanding DSM:

Threshold: >30% requires messaging revision.

## Emotional Tone (Qualitative)

Pilot A:
- Dominant tone:

Pilot B:
- Dominant tone:

Notable differences:

---

# 4. Liquidity Behavior

## Vault → Pocket Clustering
Peak % hitting slope cap in one epoch:
A:
B:

## Essential Spike Clustering
Peak % hitting essential cap:
A:
B:

Observation:
Did Pilot B show materially higher velocity pressure? (Y/N)

---

# 5. Panic Containment

Pilot A:
- Rumor spread? (Y/N)
- Time to correction acceptance:
- Behavioral escalation? (Low / Moderate / High)

Pilot B:
- Rumor spread? (Y/N)
- Time to correction acceptance:
- Behavioral escalation? (Low / Moderate / High)

Containment Verdict:
<Contained / Escalated / Fragile>

---

# 6. Participation Persistence

Initial participants:
A:
B:

Final participants:
A:
B:

Dropout %:
A:
B:

Dropout Clustering During Stress Epoch? (Y/N)

Interpretation:

---

# 7. Perception of Authority

Survey responses summary:

Did participants believe:
- Hidden admin override exists? (Y/N %)
- DSM could be extended secretly? (Y/N %)
- Caps were punitive? (Y/N %)

Authority Drift Risk:
<Low / Moderate / High>

---

# 8. MVQL Signal Behavior

Did MVQL:
- Provide clarity?
- Increase anxiety?
- Feel neutral?
- Feel controlling?

Were any MVQL metrics misunderstood?

Neutrality Verdict:
<Intact / At Risk>

---

# 9. Cross-Pilot Comparison

Where A and B diverged most:

1.
2.
3.

Was Pilot B behavior materially more unstable?
If yes, was instability mechanical or psychological?

Does framing materially alter stability?

---

# 10. Revision Targets

List required revisions:

- Messaging revision:
- Guardrail clarification:
- DSM language refinement:
- MVQL explanation clarity:
- Transparency protocol refinement:

Priority Level:
<High / Medium / Low>

---

# 11. Structural Integrity Verdict

Does the architecture:

- Preserve essential access under stress? (Y/N)
- Contain volatility without coercion? (Y/N)
- Avoid central authority perception? (Y/N)
- Maintain autonomy? (Y/N)

Overall Structural Stability:
<Stable / Needs Iteration / Fundamentally Flawed>

---

# 12. Next Decision

Choose one:

A) Iterate messaging only
B) Adjust guardrail parameters
C) Redesign stress protocol
D) Expand to larger cohort
E) Halt and reassess architecture

Selected Path:
<Choice>

Rationale:
<Short explanation>

# Final Reflection

In one paragraph:

Did this system reduce fragility
without reducing autonomy?

Answer honestly.
