# MVQL Dashboard Specification (Step 4)

## Purpose

MVQL (Minimum Viable Quality of Life) dashboard provides:

- Aggregate system health signals
- Essential floor integrity visibility
- Volatility stress indicators
- Participation expansion signals

It does NOT:
- Score individuals
- Gate access
- Trigger enforcement
- Override invariants

It informs observers.

---

# Core Principle

MVQL is observational, not operational.

It cannot:
- Freeze accounts
- Tighten caps
- Modify DSM
- Change slope rules

It may:
- Recommend review
- Flag potential fragility
- Publish trend alerts

---

# MVQL Domains

## 1. Essential Access Integrity (EAI)

Measures:
- % of essential lane requests fulfilled within cap
- EAF breach count (should be zero)
- Essential denial rate (within rule bounds)

Signal:
- Green: EAF intact
- Yellow: rising denial patterns
- Red: EAF breach detected (must be zero in certified system)

---

## 2. Volatility Stress Index (VSI)

Measures:
- Vault→Pocket velocity pressure
- DSM activation frequency
- Buffer reserve draw rate

Signal:
- Green: low stress
- Yellow: elevated stress
- Red: sustained DSM clustering

---

## 3. Participation Capacity Index (PCI)

Measures:
- Active participant count
- Median pocket liquidity
- Vault liquidity distribution
- Dormancy rates

Signal:
- Expanding
- Stable
- Contracting

---

## 4. Panic Containment Index (PCI-2)

Measures:
- Slope cap hit frequency
- Essential spike clustering
- Rumor-triggered spike patterns (if simulated)

Signal:
- Contained
- Escalating
- Uncontained

---

## 5. Governance Transparency Index (GTI)

Measures:
- DSM expiry adherence
- Review publication timeliness
- Version changes per period

Signal:
- Transparent
- Delayed
- Opaque

---

# Output Format

Dashboard must present:

- Aggregated metrics only
- No user-level data
- No identity buckets
- No predictive risk scoring
- No labels like "high risk users"

---

# Required Characteristics

- Deterministic aggregation
- Reproducible computation
- Hash-verifiable snapshots
- Publicly explainable formulas
- No proprietary black boxes

---

# Sunset Clause

If MVQL begins influencing behavior through fear or control,
it must be reviewed under:
- Institutional Risk Disclosure
- Mission Metrics Hierarchy
